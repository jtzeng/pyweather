{"name":"PyWeather","tagline":"Weather in your terminal, with ANSI colors and Unicode symbols","body":"## Description\r\n\r\nPyWeather is a script for displaying the current weather conditions in your terminal, with support for ANSI colors and Unicode symbols. It originated as a Python port of AnsiWeather, which is developed by Frederic Cambus and can be found here: https://github.com/fcambus/ansiweather; however, PyWeather's status as an exact derivative of AnsiWeather is no longer ongoing. It is currently experimental and may deviate from the original repo, although new commits and concepts may still be adopted at any time.\r\n\r\n![PyWeather Screenshot](http://oi44.tinypic.com/2i2am2s.jpg)\r\n\r\nWeather data comes from the `OpenWeatherMap` free weather API.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nPyWeather requires the following dependency: \r\n\r\n- Python 2.7\r\n\r\nThe intent in creating PyWeather is to offer an alternative which has only one dependency: Python. A standard Python installation (which is prevalent and offered on OS X and almost any other *nix box) is all that is needed.\r\n\r\nIt should also work on Windows, although there is currently no support for Unicode and console colors.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n\t./pyweather [-u imperial|metric|kelvin] [-t] [-f] city[,country]\r\n\r\nTo get a weekly forecast in addition to the current weather, use the '-f' flag.\r\n\r\nUse the '-t' flag to disable symbols.\r\n\r\nThe final argument, which is required, can be done in a numerous amount of ways. The country or country code is usually optional, but will help the weather API reduce ambiguity.\r\n\r\nYou can also discard the country or country code, as the script now prints out the name of the country.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n\t./pyweather -u metric \"New York\" \"Beijing\" \"London\" \"Rome,IT\"\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nHelp contribute to PyWeather by starring the repo, sharing it, submitting a pull request or posting an issue! :)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nPyWeather is released under the BSD 3-Clause license (which AnsiWeather is released under).
