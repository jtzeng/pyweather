{"name":"PyWeather","tagline":"Weather in your terminal, with ANSI colors and Unicode symbols","body":"## Description\r\n\r\nPyWeather is a script for displaying the current weather conditions in your terminal, with support for ANSI colors and Unicode symbols. It is a Python port of AnsiWeather, which is developed by Frederic Cambus and can be found here: https://github.com/fcambus/ansiweather.\r\n\r\n![PyWeather Screenshot](http://oi43.tinypic.com/swtouo.jpg)\r\n\r\nWeather data comes from the `OpenWeatherMap` free weather API.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nPyWeather requires the following dependency: \r\n\r\n- Python 2.7\r\n\r\nThe intent in creating PyWeather is to offer an alternative which has only one dependency: Python. A standard Python installation (which is prevalent and offered on OS X and almost any other *nix box) is all that is needed.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nAfter cloning the repository, simply invoke the script by typing:\r\n\r\n\t./pyweather\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nThe following configuration options are available and should be set according to your location and preferences.\r\n\r\nConfig options can also be set in ~/.pyweatherrc\r\n\r\nExample : `~/.pyweatherrc`\r\n\r\n\t[main]\r\n\tlocation: New York,NY\r\n\tunits: metric\r\n\tsymbols: yes\r\n\r\n\t[colors]\r\n\t...\r\n\r\n\t[icons]\r\n\t...\r\n\r\nOther options can be found in the script; they are easy to set and self-explanatory.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nPyWeather is released under the BSD 3-Clause license (which AnsiWeather is released under). See `LICENSE` file for details.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
